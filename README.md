 # Na√Øve Bee Classification

#### Task: Image Classificaiton 
#### Libraries: Scikit Learn, Scikit Image, TensforFlow/Keras, Numpy
#### Lanuage: Python
#### Source: DataCamp
#### Project Background: 
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bees play a hug ecological role -- a powerful pollinater. Study them has become an important task for healthy of bee species and in large 
&nbsp;&nbsp; the health of ecology and agriculture. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Species of bees have difference in appearances and behavior. but can a machine tell them apart?  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; in this project, utlitize CNN to build a binary bee classifer ( honey bee vs bumble bee) that can help reseacher collect field data effectiely. <br>
